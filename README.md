* **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in with email/password and Google OAuth.
* **Responsive Design**: A clean and modern UI that works beautifully on all screen sizes.
* **Theming**: Light and dark mode support, built with Tailwind CSS and CSS variables.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Van-sh/NewsFlash.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd NewsFlash
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Copy the example environment file to create your own local configuration:

    ```bash
    cp .env.dist .env
    ```

   Now, open the newly created `.env` file and fill in the required values. You will need API keys for Google (for both OAuth and Gemini), Turso, and GNews.

5. **Apply database migrations**:
   Run the following command to set up your database schema:

    ```bash
    pnpm db:migrate
    ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Development Server

1. **Start the Next.js application**:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the Next.js development server, typically on port 3000. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

2. **(Optional) Start the Genkit Developer UI**:
    To debug your AI flows, you can run the Genkit server in a separate terminal. This provides a UI to inspect traces, logs, and test your flows.

    ```bash
    pnpm genkit:dev
    ```

    This will start the Genkit development UI, typically on port 4000.
